## Requirements

This drill assumes you know how to:

## The mission

```sh

You need to install _{package}_ on your machine and you've been told that most
Unix operating system have a tool for that, the *package manager*.

You've heard that the package manager for *Ubuntu based distribution* is
`apt-get`  or the newer one `apt`. Open your *terminal* and *read its manual* to understand it, then
follow the instructions below. 

> [!NOTE] 
> If you use another distribution, find out which package manager it uses
and research it.

### Instructions
1. update all the packages on you system
2. search if your distribution has _{package}_
3 install _{package}_
4. launch _{package}_
5. remove _{package}_

> [!TIP] Useful info
> There are plenty of package manager across a lot of operating system, Mac uses
`brew`, Archlinux uses `pacman`, even languages such as NodeJS (`npm`), Python
(`pip`) and PHP (`composer`) use them to manage dependencies.

## Congrats

In the world of Unix/Linux you rarely download a program from its website. Rather
each distribution as a *repository* of softwares to install, which you can
consult with your *package manager*.
