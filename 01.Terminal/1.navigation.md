* consult the manual within the terminal


## The mission

You've heard of three new commands to explore the file-system `cd`, `ls` and

follow the instructions below.

### Instructions
1. print your location on the screen
2. print the content of your current directory
3. print the content of `/`
4. move to the folder `/bin`
5. print your new location
6. go back to your home folder

amazing warping power.

1. move to any location on your file system for a quick job
2. pop back to your previous location to get back to work


## Congrats

You can now sail across your system. If you're brave enough learn more about the
Linux file system and understand what's the purpose of the folders in `/`.
